I've gone through the book C Programming Language (2nd Edition) perhaps 3 times already and my programs are scattered around innumerable jump drives, hard drives, or other media. 

This repository is intended for personal use and posterity. I have not formatted my code to be a teaching tool but if anyone finds use in it then more power to you. If you find that you have some suggestions to how the code is formatted or written in general feel free to contact me.
